## Example

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

(async () => {
  const sporadic = require('sporadic')
  const channel = await sporadic.channels.open()

  const wasReceivedPromise = sporadic.channels.send(channel, "Hello, World!")
  const messagePromise = sporadic.channels.receive(channel)
  const promises = [ wasReceivedPromise, messagePromise ]

  const [ wasReceived, message ] = await Promise.all(promises)
  console.log(wasReceived) // ==> true
  console.log(message) // ==> Hello, World!
})()
```

---

## Installation

Through UNPKG (for browsers):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/sporadic/dist/index.js"></script>
```

Through NPM:

```shell
$ npm install sporadic
```

---

To install the development snapshot, use `npm link`.
For example, on this cloned repository:

```shell
$ npm link .
```

And then, on your project:

```shell
$ npm link sporadic
```

Stable releases are tags in the branch `release`. The `master` branch here is
only to track the next releases, please don't rely too much on that branch. All
the hard work is made on the `development` branch.

## Documentation

For every submodule within this `sporadic` library, there's an API documentation
available at the directory `docs/` under the filename `SUBMODULE.md`, where
`SUBMODULE` stands for the submodule provided with this library (yes, I know the
redundancy :joy:). Each submodule corresponds to a concurrency abstraction.
Currently, the following abstractions are implemented:

- [sporadic.streams][1], an abstraction for reactive streams made of multiple
  publishers and multiple subscribers. The subscription process is implicit,
  the reference for the stream object is all that is needed.
- [sporadic.channels][2], an abstraction for synchronous queues made of many
  producers and consumers. This concurrent data type is a bare minimal tool for
  pipelines of chained producers and consumers.
- [sporadic.coroutines][3], an abstraction for suspendable subroutines. Such
  abstraction also behaves as a task/promise whenever we wait for the final
  coroutine result (but keep in mind that coroutines can "loop" forever). It's kinda
  like the JavaScript generators, with the sole difference of being asynchronous
  instead synchronous calls (and thus, allowing us to mix asynchronous I/O with that).
